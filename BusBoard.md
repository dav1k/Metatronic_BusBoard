    * This the "shrouded" Eurorack power header. 
- Metatronic Mods Bus Board PCB.

## Part Prep

The screw terminals need to be dissembled. The item linked to Amazon is a bag of 60 pcs; 10x 3pin and 50x 2pin.

For whatever reason, manufacturing, etc.; the 3pin part dissembles very easily. Simply unscrew the screw till it drops out of the housing. Then you can push the metal terminal and the leaf spring out of the plastic housing. 

**Note:** The 2pin counterparts do not dissemble easily. Upon completely unscrewing the screw, it does not fall out. Moreso, the screw still remains fully encloused in the plastic housing. Unfortunately, the plastic housing needs to be cut apart using a knife. It is only then that the screw can be dislodged, and the metal terminal & leaf spring can be removed.

*Author's Note:* I personally think that the 2pin screw headers sourced in this grab bag from Amazon might be the "more official" or better copied part. Therefore, should one source these sorts of parts from a more reputable vendor, you may have to simply cut apart the plastic housing to full dissemble. It is clear more research diving around the parts bin is needed.

Ultimately, this procedure serves to source the small metal terminals.

**EDIT/UPDATE:** The 2pin terminals can be non-destructively dissembled. Insert a small set of tweesers under the leaf spring. Apply pressure in the direction normal to the metal housing; basically attempt to pull the leaf spring out. Unscrew the screw; you should feel additional friction on the screw. The screw should completely dislodge itself and one can remove the internal metal terminal.

The screws here are tapered on the very last few threads. This allows the user to completely unscrew the screw without the screw dislodging. It makes sense as this is desired behavior during the normal operation of the screw terminal. Applying the force onto the leaf spring as directed forces the leaf spring to always thread against the screw, especially during the final threads; this allows the screw to dislodge itself.
